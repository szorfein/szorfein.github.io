I alrealy use some programming language like:

+ PHP

+ C
+ Python
+ Ruby
+ Bash

Music:  

Depend on the moment, i can listen to trance(goa, psychedelic), power noize, ambiant, classic, jazz, hip-hop, psychill...  
I prefer the musics without any voices, it helps me to stay concentrate.

Kitchen: yeah i manage the base :) 

I can cook many things like [brioche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brioche), [beef bourguigon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_bourguignon), [chili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili), pizza, cookie, Algerian Couscous and many other recipes.
